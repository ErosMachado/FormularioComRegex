# FormWithRegex

A simple web page project that demonstrates the use of regular expressions for searching, validating, and replacing data such as emails, CPFs, dates, and passwords.

This project is an interactive web page that allows users to perform four operations using regular expressions (regex): search for emails within a text, validate CPF in the Brazilian format, replace dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format with YYYY-MM-DD, and validate complex passwords with specific criteria. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for validation and data manipulation logic, keeping the code organized in separate files. This provides a practical interface for testing and learning regex in various common text manipulation and input validation scenarios on web pages.

I will add more things in the future.
